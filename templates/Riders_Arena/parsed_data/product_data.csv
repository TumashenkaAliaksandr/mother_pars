Comfort and fit – 4-way stretch, compression fit Decent thickness providing shock absorption and long-lasting comfort. Care and more – Waterproof socks are waterproof from the toe to just below the cuff of the sock. Do not submerge them in water completely. Always wear waterproof socks inside your footwear. Do not puncture the membrane . Don’t hang in direct sun for several weeks, or socks may lose their elasticity. Regularly inspect the inside of your footwear for stones, thorns and other sharp objects that could damage the waterproof membrane. Washing instructions – Hand wash using water that is under 40 degree Celsius Take some lukewarm water in a mug or bowl. Add a little gentle dish soap or delicate hand wash detergent and have a piece of cloth ready. Dip the cloth in soapy water and wipe the outsides of your socks and remove any dirt. Turn your socks inside out and submerge them in the water. Let them soak for 5-10 minutes, then use your hands to gently rub the insides of the socks. Keeping your socks inside out, run them under lukewarm water to rinse off the soap. Let them dry naturally inside and then out, avoid drying on a direct heat source to prevent damaging the waterproof membrane. We recommend laying them out flat instead of hang drying.

HIGH HEAT TOLERANCE: CRANK1 Sintered brake pads excellent in high-temperature conditions, making them suitable for aggressive riding, track use, or challenging terrains. They maintain their performance even under heavy braking & preventing brake fade. EXCELLENT STOPPING POWER CRANK1 Sintered Pads offer strong and consistent stopping power, making them ideal for riders who demand precise control and responsiveness from their brakes. This is especially important in situations that require quick stops. LONGER LIFESPAN: Due to their robust construction, CRANK1 sintered series typically have a longer lifespan than organic or alternatives. This can result in fewer replacements and reduced maintenance costs over time. VERSATILITY: CRANK1 Sintered series perform well in various weather conditions, including wet or muddy environments. They maintain their effectiveness even when wet, providing reliable stopping power in diverse riding conditions. LESS BRAKE FADE: CRANK1 Sintered Pads helps in minimise brake fade. SUITABLE FOR TOURING: CRANK1 Sintered Pads are often recommended for motorcycles carrying heavy loads, such as touring bikes or those used for long-distance travel. Their durability and heat resistance make them well-suited for these applications. Please refer to image for size/specification. Specific pressure                : P < 5,1 Mpa Sliding speed                      : V <30 m. Constant maximum temp   : 680 °C Short time maximum temp : 830°C FEATURES: Very high static friction coefficient Low abrasive interaction with the brake rotor material Special braking surface modification A stainless-steel heat shield for thermal isolation fitted on the back side of the brake lining Minimal difference between braking performance in dry and wet conditions High quality abrasive resistance High braking power up to 660°C (max. 830°C) The sintered friction material is soldered to the copper coated backing plate, so separation (which can happen with organic material) is virtually eliminated as a failure risk"
